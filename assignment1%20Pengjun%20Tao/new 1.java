Article Review: 'A view of 20th and 21st Century Software Engineering File'

In this article,the author summarized and made a conculsion on the software engineering in the past years.
From the article,we could distinguish many important and different types of software engineering and find that the concept of software engineering is large and various.
The author summarized the software engineering from the 1950's in the beginning of the article and said it is like hardware engineering.
Boehm tell us that most people were told to "engineer software like you engineer hardware.",and it resulted in a sequential
waterfall-type model.Actually,the software engineers were similar to hardware engineers or mathematicians in that time.
However,there was a big improvement on the hardware.It was developed quickly and no longer a limitation in software engineering now.
Then the author discussed the field during the 1960's.The easier modification on software has a big influence which help 
people and organizations to adopt a "code and fix" approach to their software development.
It will let people realize that making change on software is much easier than making change on hardware.
What's more,it became much easier for non-engineering people to enter the field of software engineering with the development of various and important programming languages. 
They could adapt the code and fix model easily,quickly and comfortably.The model is more of what we see in software industry today
Changing on software has much more beneficial than hardware,and more and more people shifted the focus on code and fix.
During 1960's,the software engineering has a big improvement,and people thought a good ognized software engineering methods to be designed carefully.
The Structured Programming has a big movement and influence during 1970's.The movement cotained two partition:Formality and Water Processes.
We could learn that a synthesis in form of the formal procecces in that time.The formal movement focused on the correctness of the software program.
And the waterfall model emerged during 1970's which with a "build it twice" prototyping activity before committing to fullscale development. 
The waterfall processes focused on the structured programming. However,most people thought the waterfall procecces was only a purely sequential model.
As Boehm stated "the waterfall model was most frequently interpreted as a purely sequential process, in which design did not start until there was a complete set of requirements, and coding did not start until completion of an exhaustive critical design review."
At the end of the 1970’s,the systems became more complex.And the problems emerged with both of two movements,they were cropping up with formality and sequential 
We could find that the formal mothods was to difficult for the majority of less-expert programmers and also wasn’t scalable enough.
For the waterfall processes,it really resulted in buggy code.Because some managers no longer pushed their teams to documenting,but the managers often push them to coding.
As Boehm said in the article, the 1980’s were primarily about productivity and scalability of the software engineering.
And people focused on the productive software, not just the software which was develop only to do one particular work. 
The most important,more higher-level programming languages emerged during this peroid.
Software developers have more opportunities to code up more various software with the higher-level programming languages.
During 1990’s,it introduced an concurrent vs. the sequential processes.Some newer technologies/design processes has a bigger improvement.They allowed engineers to
develop their program more powerful,robust and versatile.
Another improvement of concurrent engineering was the open source community. Because it,the advatanges of the usability of software became very important for developers.
In the 2000’s,there was partial synthesis and antithesis.Most people was frustrated
with the big,mess and heavy plans for their work.So specifications,documentation and several agile methods were introduced in software engineering.
Apart from this,developers also had to solve problem with the integrating older technologies,and dealing more with older code.
Also model driven development became very popular

Boehm make a predication in the article.He said systems of systems
and reuse of the COTS will be the primary points of development in the 2010’s.
Beyond that Boehm predicts:The systems will be smarter,more artificial intelligent and more adaptive.
Software engineering has evolved a great deal over the last years,and the limitations on that are still far way. 
We could put more energy on dealing with some science issues with computers,such as the bioinformatics.

The paper was good structured and easy to read and understand.
I think the author did a excied job on identifying strengths and weaknesses with best explanations or explanations.
This paper primarily discussed the different software processes which emerged over time. 
Boehm try to point out the strengths and weaknesses of during each period by analyzing the history of software engineering.
What's more,the author also identify the success and failure factors during each period,and give us some positive and negative points.
